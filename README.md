# This project is not viable. It is still in development

# My awesome libft - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FauconFan/my_awesome_libft.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FauconFan/my_awesome_libft)

Contains the awesome libft.

The idea is to create a minimal library that contains the minimum libc as possible, just using 6 systems functions:
 - read
 - write
 - malloc
 - free
 - exit

## How to test it

You can edit the file main.c in the src directory,
then use make test, it will compile the library, compile the main file, run it and delete all useless files in the same time.
