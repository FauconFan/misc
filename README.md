# In Honor Of Pi

The idea is to create a program that provide a dynamic view (as Canvas) of the given picture in Inspiration.  
This come from all of a bunch of articles published for the Pi day in 2018.  

# How to run

You need Java 8 to run this program (Never tried with a Java 7 in fact...)  
Then :
```bash
make
java -jar HonorPi.jar
```

You can Zoom In/Zoom Out with P and M keyboard.  
Then you can modify the camera with up / right / left / down keyboard...
