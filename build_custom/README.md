# Build custom

This folder is for the build_custom module. You give him a path project as a argument, and it builds the minimal libft project in /rendu folder.

You have to respect the architecture of the repository. It will not work if you move folders...

```bash
make run PARAM=[YOUR PATH FROM THIS FOLDER]
```
