# Go-Huffman

This project is a small training workspace to learn Go Programming Language

The goal was to generate Huffman tree, then encode, but also decode if we get the right Huffman tree

```
go build && ./huffman
```

This command will launch the main function, encode all files in the slice in main.go file, then decode and compare. Prints "OK" if it works or "NON" if it fails
